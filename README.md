# EnigmaKeyBrute
## About
This is a *not-so-great* Enigma bruteforce tool for the key values and starting positions. 
It relies on a crib (known plaintext) and also requires the daily keysheet to be known (this includes rotors, reflector, ring settings, and the plugboard settings)
## Install
Make sure you have py-engima installed:

`pip3 install py-enigma`
